# Python Parser Project

This repo contains Deliverables 1–3 and a Python script (maketree.py) used to generate and print a parse tree. All work was done by Joseph Coryell. To run the project, first generate the parser with ANTLR using: antlr4 -Dlanguage=Python3 PythonParser3.g4. Then run maketree.py on any Python file using: python maketree.py filename.py. The script will parse the file and print the resulting ANTLR parse tree
